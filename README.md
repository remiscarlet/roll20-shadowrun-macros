# Roll20 "Shadowrun 5th" Charsheet Template Macros

For use with the [Shadowrun 5th](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/Shadowrun5th) Character Sheet template available on Roll20.

These macros are not compatible with other character sheets.

## Sources?

These are based off of the literal roll values used in the character sheet linked above. The macros have been adjusted to work with selected tokens and to use bar2/bar3 for physical/stun wound tracking.
